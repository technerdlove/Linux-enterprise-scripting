Here is an assignment to research and explain the use of four *nix commands   
for basic shell programming (Learning the Bash Shell text)
===============


TO RUN A BASH SCRIPT:
$ source <scriptname>  
Or simply type the scriptname and hit RETURN.


NOTE: If the script isn't in your command search path, 
you must type ./scriptname (which is the same
  	as typing the script’s absolute pathname)


NOTE: You must give your script execute permission explicitly to run it.  Otherwise, you will get a message of <scriptname>: Permission denied


	NOTE: Typing in the name of the script and hitting RETURN does the following:
		1. It causes the shell to run another copy of the shell as a subprocess,
			known as a subshell.
		2. The subshell then takes commands from the script, runs them, and 
terminates, handing control back to the parent shell.
3. While all of this is happening, you have to wait until the process is
finished before you can enter further commands.


NOTE: Using source to run the script causes the commands in the script to be run as if they were a part of your login session.
	


TO GIVE A SCRIPT EXECUTE PERMISSION:
	$ chmod +x  <scriptname>




TO MAKE A COMMAND RUN IN THE BACKGROUND:
	$ <command> &


	NOTE:  Running a command in the background allows you to enter further commands
		in the terminal while the background command is being processed.


TO DEFINE A BASH FUNCTION:			
					
function <functname>
{
	shell commands
} 


OR 


<functname>
()
{
shell commands
}	


	
			
TO FIND OUT WHAT FUNCTIONS ARE DEFINED IN YOUR LOGIN SESSION”
$ declare -f


$ declare -F




TO KNOW THE EXACT SOURCE OF A COMMAND:
$ type
$ type -all
$ type -p (for executables)
$ type -P (for executables)
$ type -f (suppresses shell function lookup, so only keywords, files, and 
aliases are returned)		
	$ type -t (restricts definition to a single word descriptor, e.g. alias, keyword, etc.)




TO DEFINE VALUES FOR BASH VARIABLES:
	$ <varname>=<value>


	NOTE:  You can’t place a space on either side of the equal sign. The assignment won’t 
		work.
