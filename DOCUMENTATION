The purpose of this file is to document processes for NTI300 assignments.
=================================

This is the assignment:
Script Apache install and website creation:
Create a bash script 
(hint, you can use https://github.com/nic-instruction/NTI-300/blob/master/install_scripts/install-apache (Links to an external site.) as a base)
that installs enables and starts apache
Then adds a static HTML page to the apache server.  
For extra credit, automate adding a second page that is gated by an .htaccess file and permissions for two users to view it.
After you have added these new files, automatically restart or reload apache.

-----------------------------------
These are the steps:

Use Nicole's script: https://github.com/nic-instruction/NTI-300/blob/master/install_scripts/install-apache
Create index.html with a basic html template
//add more later
