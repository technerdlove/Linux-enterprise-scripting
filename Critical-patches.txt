Here I complete the following assignment:
We will analyze the bug found in the linux kernel and come up with a plan for patching our systems.  
This should only take a half hour or so of class time.  
To complete this assignment, submit the names of the machines you patched and the commands you used to do so, 
along with an estimated cost for spinning up each machine.

MACHINES PATCHED
Only had one instance running

COMMANDS TO PATCH MACHINES (AS A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE)
1.  Make a file named my_machines
2. Enter a list of your ip addresses in file my_machines
   Note: To find aws server ip addresses, go to management console and copy and paste public ip
3. Create a bash script with the following lines:

cat my_machines

for i in $( cat my_machines ); do ssh -t -i “load-ballancer-static-content.pem” ec2-user@$i “sudo yum clean al && sudo yum update kernel && sudo reboot”; done
# replace oad-ballancer-static-content.pem with the name of your key

4. Save and close script
5. On command line, make script executable by typing chmod +x nameofyourpatchscript
6. Run script 

ESTIMATED COST
miniscule
